# Power Inverter Development Repository

### Features

- The 3-phase 30A@450V power inverter with control board for research purposes;
- This inverter has built-in measurements of AC currents, AC voltages and DC bus voltage;
- The inverter is based on infineon IPM IKCM60F30GA module (a ultra low-cost module, with integrated drivers);
- The control board is based on XMC4500 Relax (lite) kit, a well known board in UP Laboratory of Power Electronics;
- Reduced cost of hardware (around 100€);

### How to use

- TODO

### TODO

- Define functional requirements of this project
- Create BOM for 10 boards (expecting 1000€)
-
- Create "how to use" manual
